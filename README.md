This is a visualization site for an experiment done to demonstrate the efficacy of malicious prompt defense techniques (prompt injections/vaccines), for a NeurIPS 2025 workshop.

You can run your own experiment with the ipynb in `/resources/`.

There are more charts in the colab and we have data formatted for radar charts, heatmaps, etc. If we wanted we could add those in this demo too.
